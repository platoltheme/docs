Follow one of our guides to integrate images and videos from a hosted media service.

## Hosted Media Guides

<MediaGuidesNav />

## Why use hosted media?

Hosted media helps individuals, teams, and organizations store, manage, optimize and deliver their image and video assets with dedicated APIs from a central location.

This centralization can be useful particularly when using a single source of truth for your assets between multiple web or mobile properties. This is important if you're part of an organization that requires multiple teams to use the same assets, or are integrating into other content systems like a PIM (Product Information Manager) to connect your assets to products.

Image hosting services can transform and optimize your images, automatically delivering optimized versions for your visitor.

Video hosting services like [Mux](/en/guides/media/mux/) can provide live-streaming platforms and customizable video players, giving significant performance and scaling benefits over handling local content. They will handle video transcoding, compression, and transformation to provide a smooth user experience. A platform like Mux may also additionally include data analysis for understanding your user engagement.

## Which hosted media systems work well with Astro?

Much like when using a CMS, as Astro handles the _presentation_ of your content, you'll want to use hosted services that allow you to fetch and interact with your assets via an API or SDK.

## Can I use Astro without a hosted media system?

Yes! Astro provides built-in ways to [store images](/en/guides/images/#where-to-store-images), including support for referencing remote images.

However, there is no native video support in Astro, and we recommend choosing a service like [Mux](/en/guides/media/mux/) to handle the demands of optimizing and streaming video content.
