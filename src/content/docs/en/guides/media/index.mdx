## Hosted Media Guides

<MediaGuidesNav />

## Why use hosted media?

Hosted media helps individuals, teams, and organizations manage their image and video assets from a central location much like a [CMS](/en/guides/cms/).

- Store, transform, optimize, and deliver media with powerful APIs, intuitive widgets, and a user-friendly interface.
- real-time video transcoding, content-aware compression, on-the-fly video transformation, and more.
- Cloudinaryâ€™s API-first DAM unites developers, commerce teams, and marketers by providing a single source of truth, enabling seamless file uploads and connections to any application through integrations, APIs, and widgets.
- Mux solves the hard problems software teams face when building video, from live-streaming platforms to on-demand video catalogs to AI-generated video platforms and anything in between. Developers use Mux to launch video features in minutes, customize the player experience, and monitor video streaming performance, all while scaling seamlessly.

The difference is the type of content being managed: a digital asset manager would primarily manage images, videos, other media assets like 3D models, and any metadata associated with those assets.

This can be useful particularly when using a single source of truth for your assets between multiple web or mobile properties. This is important if you're part of an organization that requires multiple teams to use the same assets, or are integrating into other content systems like a PIM (Product Information Manager) to connect your assets to products.

## Which hosted media systems or DAMs work well with Astro?

Much like when using a CMS, as Astro handles the _presentation_ of your content, you'll want to use a headless DAM that allows you to fetch and interact with your assets via an API or SDK.

Some headless DAMs, like Cloudinary, provide an Astro [integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/) that allows you to easily fetch your assets as well as display them on your website or app.

## Can I use Astro without a hosted media system or DAM?

Yes! Astro provides built-in ways to [store images](/en/guides/images/#where-to-store-images), including support for referencing remote images.
