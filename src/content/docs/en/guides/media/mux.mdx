[Mux](https://mux.com) is a hosted media service that provides video streaming infrastructure and performance analytics for businesses of all scale.

When you use Mux to store and host your video content, you'll have access to built in web components such as [Mux Player](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/mux-player-web), a drop in component for adding Mux videos in your Astro project, and [Mux Uploader](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/mux-uploader) for uploading videos to Mux from your website. You can use [Mux Data](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/data) to track your video engagement and performance.

## Using Mux in Astro

Mux's APIs and web components work in Astro to compress and optimize your videos for the web, adapt the quality of your video to network conditions, and integrate additional features like captions, thumbnails, and analytics. The [Mux Node SDK](https://github.com/muxinc/mux-node-sdk) supports both Mux Data and Mux Video.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Astro project. If you don’t have an Astro project yet, our [Installation guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/) will get you up and running in no time.
- A Mux account. If you don’t have an account, you can [sign up with Mux](https://dashboard.mux.com/login) for a free account.

## Playing videos

In Astro, you can use the full-featured [Mux Player](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/mux-player-web) and the [Mux Video element](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/play-your-videos#mux-video-element) for optimized, responsive video playback. These both have built-in support for Mux's data analytics, and will automatically show visitor engagement and video quality metrics in your dashboard once your video has views on your deployed site.

### Mux Player

Mux Player provides a responsive UI based on video player dimensions and stream type, automatic thumbnail previews and poster images, and modern video player capabilities (fullscreen, picture-in-picture, Chromecast, AirPlay).

Mux Player can be used in Astro as a web component (`<mux-player>`), as a React component (`<MuxPlayer />`), or as a web embed (`<iframe>`). To use either component, install the appropriate package using your preferred package manager:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">
  ```shell
  npm install @mux/mux-player@latest #or @mux/mux-player-react@latest
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn add @mux/mux-player@latest #or @mux/mux-player-react@latest
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You will need the `playback-id` for your video asset which can be found in your Mux dashboard. All other [options to control the Mux web player](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/player-api-reference/) (e.g. hide or display controls, style elements, disable cookies) are optional:

```astro title="src/components/StarlightVideo.astro"
<script>import "@mux/mux-player"</script>

<mux-player
  playback-id="FOTbeIxKeMPzyhrob722wytaTGI02Y3zbV00NeFQbTbK00"
  metadata-video-title="Starlight by Astro"
  accent-color="#6e1e99"
  primary-color="#f2ec3a"
  secondary-color="#0caa09"
  default-show-remaining-time
></mux-player>
```

### Mux Video 

Mux Video is a drop-in replacement for the HTML5 `<video>` element that provides browser support for HLS playback, and has Mux Data automatically configured to show visitor and performance metrics. Use this when you do not need or want all the features of [Mux Player](#mux-player).

Mux Video can be used as a web component (`<mux-video>`), or as a React component (`<MuxVideo />`). To use either component, install the appropriate package using your preferred package manager:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">
  ```shell
  npm install @mux/mux-video # or npm install @mux/mux-video-react
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn add @mux/mux-video # or yarn add @mux/mux-video-react
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You will need the `playback-id` for your video asset which can be found in your Mux dashboard. All attributes for the HTML 5 `<video>` element (e.g. `poster`, `controls`, `muted`) are available, as well as additional Mux video player controls (e.g. to provide metadata, control the resolution, disable cookies):

```astro title="src/components/StarlightVideo.astro"
<script>import '@mux/mux-video'</script>

<mux-video
  playback-id="FOTbeIxKeMPzyhrob722wytaTGI02Y3zbV00NeFQbTbK00"
  metadata-video-title="Starlight by Astro"
  controls
  disable-tracking
></mux-video>
```
