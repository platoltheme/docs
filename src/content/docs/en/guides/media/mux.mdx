[Mux](https://mux.com) is a hosted media service that provides video streaming infrastructure and performance analytics for businesses of all scale.

When you use Mux to store and host your video content, you'll have access to built in web components such as [Mux Player](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/mux-player-web), a drop in component for adding Mux videos in your Astro project, and [Mux Uploader](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/mux-uploader) for uploading videos to Mux from your website. You can use [Mux Data](https://www.mux.com/docs/guides/data) to track your video engagement and performance.

## Using Mux in Astro

Mux's APIs and web components work in Astro to compress and optimize your videos for the web, adapt the quality of your video to network conditions, and integrate additional features like captions, thumbnails, and analytics. The [Mux Node SDK](https://github.com/muxinc/mux-node-sdk) supports both Mux Data and Mux Video.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Astro project. If you don’t have an Astro project yet, our [Installation guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/) will get you up and running in no time.
- A Mux account. If you don’t have an account, you can [sign up with Mux](https://dashboard.mux.com/login) for a free account.

## Playing videos

In `.astro` files, you can use the Mux Player HTML web component for a fully-functioned, responsive video player.

The info page for each video asset in your Mux dashboard will contain the code you can copy into your `.astro` template:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mux/mux-player"></script>

<h1>My Video</h1>

<mux-player
  playback-id="BO022h5L00lyks87I7Dk8ww1sMS4A8Y5gFdcRaxYCXbjU"
  metadata-viewer-user-id="Placeholder (optional)"
  metadata-video-title="talkinganddocingtheme"
></mux-player>
```
